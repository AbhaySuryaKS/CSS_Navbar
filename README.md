# CSS Navbar with Animated Gradient and Hover Effects

A sleek, responsive, and interactive navigation bar with animated gradients and hover effects. This project demonstrates how to build a modern, visually appealing navbar with CSS and HTML, perfect for enhancing the user interface of any website.

## Features

1. **Responsive Design**:
   - The navbar adapts to different screen sizes, with a flexible width from `400px` to `900px`, making it suitable for mobile and desktop views.

2. **Hover Effects**:
   - Each navigation link has a hover effect that changes the color to `orangered` and expands a decorative line underneath.
   - On click, the link grows slightly with a glowing red shadow for a more interactive feel.

3. **Animated Gradients**:
   - A dynamic, infinite animated gradient bar at the top and bottom of the navbar adds a modern touch, with colors flowing smoothly from red to navy.

4. **Background Image**:
   - The page background includes a centered, cover-size image (`back.png`) that adjusts to the viewport size.

5. **No JavaScript**:
   - This project uses purely HTML and CSS, making it lightweight and fast to load.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For creating the structure of the navigation bar.
- **CSS3**: For styling the navbar, adding hover effects, and implementing the animated gradients.

## Project Structure

- **`index.html`**: The HTML file containing the layout and structure of the navigation bar.
- **`style.css`**: The CSS file that defines the styles for the navbar, links, animations, and page layout.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the project files: `index.html` and `style.css`.
2. Ensure you have a background image (`back.png`) in the same directory as the `index.html` file, or replace the `background` property in the CSS with your own image.
3. Open `index.html` in any modern browser to view the animated navbar.

## Customization

1. **Background Image**:
   - Change the background image by modifying the `background` property in the `body` selector in `style.css`.

2. **Navbar Colors**:
   - Modify the color of the gradient animation by changing the values in the `#grad` and `#grad2` selectors.

3. **Link Colors and Effects**:
   - Customize the hover color, text shadow, and scale effects by adjusting the `a:hover` and `a:active` selectors in the CSS.

4. **Gradient Animation Speed**:
   - To speed up or slow down the gradient animation, change the value of the `animation: move` property in the `#grad` and `#grad2` selectors.
